<h2> What is the goal of Baseball?</h2>
<img src="baseball.jpg" alt="Pick off attempt."><img src="bat.webp" alt="Bat on ball."><br><br>
<p> The main goal of baseball is to <strong><em>score more runs than the opposing team</em></strong> through either <strong>fielding the ball</strong> and getting players out by beating them to the base with the ball or throwing the ball to the basemen OR <strong>hitting the ball</strong> with a bat and running and touching around the bases, eventually <strong><em>making it to home base and scoring a run for your team.</em></strong> The game is played in usually a period of <strong>8 or more innings</strong> (depending on the score) and each team will spend <strong><em>one half of the inning either batting or fielding the ball.</em></strong></p><br><br>
