<h1>Rules and Info</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Baseball is played in periods of 8 innings with one team batting in one half and fielding in the other. The batting team will use bats and then get pitched (thrown at by the ball) at by the fielding team and try their best to hit it and run around the bases (once they do hit it), meanwhile the fielding team must get the ball and throw it back to the base the runner is about to get to before they do to get them out OR use the ball and tag them out.</p>

<h2>Teams and Innings</h2>
<p>Baseball is played between two teams of nine players each, divided into nine innings, with each inning having two halves: the top half (where the visiting team bats that is not from that location/area) and the bottom half (where the home team who is from that location/area bats).</p>
